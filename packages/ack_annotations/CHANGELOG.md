## 1.3.0

### Changed

* Align with the coordinated Ack 1.3 release introducing `ack_mcp_dart`;
  this package has no runtime or public API changes from 1.2.0.

## 1.2.0

### Added

* Add `@AckInfer()` for immutable schema-first model generation. Custom names
  are exact and annotated libraries declare `.ack.dart` plus `.ack.g.dart`.
* Add class-first `@AckModel()`, `@AckField`, constraint annotations,
  unknown-property modes, exact schema facade names, and the generated JSON
  marker used by Ack-owned output.

### Deprecated

* Deprecate only `@AckType()`. It will be removed in Ack 2.0.0; use
  `@AckInfer()` for schema-first models or `@AckModel()` for class-first
  models. Its Ack 1.1 name suffixing and generated extension-type APIs remain
  unchanged until removal.

### Changed

* Raise the minimum Dart SDK to 3.9.
* Make the new `AckInfer` and internal JSON marker annotation classes final.
* Finalize the pre-release class-first API as `AckUnknownPropertyPolicy`,
  `unknownProperties`, and `captureField`, with no deprecated aliases.

### Improvements

* **AckType**: Refined annotation parameters and improved type handling (#50).
* **AckField**: Improved field annotation correctness (#50).
* **Breaking**: `AckField.required` was replaced by `requiredMode` (`AckFieldRequiredMode.auto|required|optional`). Migrate `@AckField(required: true)` to `@AckField(requiredMode: AckFieldRequiredMode.required)` and `required: false` to `requiredMode: AckFieldRequiredMode.optional`.
